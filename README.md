# Australian Retail Sales Analysis
Interactive and static sales dashboards built in Microsoft Excel, completed during my summer data analysis internship at **Konecta** (2025). The dataset is a synthetic retail sales dataset provided for training purposes.

## Overview

The dataset covers three Australian states (NSW, VIC, WA) from 2013 to 2017, with 1,039 orders, 27,060 units sold, $1.13 million in total sales, 14 account managers, and four customer segments. The project had two deliverables: a static summary dashboard and a fully interactive one with slicers for filtering by year, state, and account manager.


## Dashboards

Covers overall KPIs, state and segment distribution via pie charts, a year by state combo chart, and an account manager table with sparkline trends for 2013–2016.

The same metrics made filterable via slicers for year, state, and account manager. All charts and KPI cards update dynamically. The third image shows it filtered to 2015 as a usage example.
